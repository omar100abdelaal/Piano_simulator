# Piano-Simulator-Noise-Cancellation
Here I implemented a python project to generate music and cancel noise out of it.
## Installation
You may need to install the dependencies to be able to run it.

```sh
pip install sounddevice
```


The following 2 figure demonstrates the project
where the first part of the 2 figures represents the original signal, the second for the noised signal and the third for the filtered signal
